            <h1>Who are Undocumented Immigrants and Workers?</h1>
            <li>An Undocumented Immigrant is a person residing in the United States that was not born here and is not a permeant resident or United States citizen.  ("Undocumented Workers") Because these residents of the United States do not have an official status, they often do not possess official documents, such as IDs, Passports, or Social Security Numbers. This has led to the labeling of these populations as undocumented, who often obtain work without these official documents.</li>

            <h1>Why do undocumented immigrants seek opportunities in the United States?</h1>
            <li>Immigrants and Refugees seek jobs and opportunities in the United States, because of the wage discrepancy between the United States and their home countries.</li>

            <li>No. Past studies have shown that undocumented workers and native American workers do not compete for the same types of jobs. (Brauw) Even within unskilled professions, immigration has been shown to have little to no correlation with decreases in wages. (Peri)</li>

            <h1>Are Undocumented Workers and Immigrants Legal?</h1>
            <li>Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is unlawful to knowingly “hire…recruit, or refer for a fee” any undocumented worker or immigrant. However, immigrants and refugees often come to the United States seeking the opportunities of American dream, and are patriotic, law-abiding, and tax-paying citizens. Recent studies also demonstrate that an increase in the population of undocumented immigrants also results in a decrease in the number of violent crimes committed (Light and Miller).</li>

            <h1>How do undocumented workers receive jobs?</h1>
            <li>Based on a key findings publication by the Scholars Strategy Network, undocumented immigrants obtain jobs primarily through three methods:</li>
            <li>Method 1: Borrow identification documents from a citizen or legal permanent resident of the United States, such as a friend or family member. These identity loans can benefit both the undocumented worker, by allowing them to find work, as well as the lender of the identity, by accumulating “payroll tax deductions” and increasing the value of unemployment checks.</li>
            <li>Method 2: Form an agreement with the employer to work under the table without legal documentation.</li>
            <li>Method 3: Steal, or purchase counterfeit identity documents.</li>

            <h1>How does the United States treat Undocumented Workers and Immigrants?</h1>
            <li>Under the zero-tolerance policies of 45th Presidential Administration, immigrants, migrants, and asylum seekers have been systemically detained, separated from their children, and charged with criminal offences. This focus on long-term detainment and separation is not only expensive but also detrimental to the health and wellbeing of immigrants and their families. This policy has also been shown to do little to discourage undocumented immigration ("The Trump").</li>
