#### Service as Advocacy Project on Undocumented Workers

2020-2021 | Junior Year in High School

---


After attending the **2020 Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice**, I had the opportunity to complete a "Service as Advocacy Project" for my Junior Theology Class.

I first decided to focus this project and my research on undocumented workers. I then settled on putting together this website to synthesize and share what I had learned.

While the information on this site requires updates and expansion, I have preserved the site here as I wrote it for my class. 

This project was my first comprehensive experiment with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. When I first launched this project, I **self-hosted** the website on a **Raspberry Pi** with the **Apache webserver**. The setup kept the site online for three years until I decided to move it here in 2023 for stability and a chance to show some of my programming development.
